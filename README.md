# ✏️ About
Astralic UI is a roblox script made on a phone for phones. These are the games that i made for, with the main focus on the first one:
- Car Dealership Tycoon
- Pet Simulator 99
- SharkBite 2
- Build a Boat for Treasure
- Murder Mystery 2

🔎 NOTE: Both main and prototype scripts are combined into a single loadstring which is this:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://astronomic.vercel.app"))()
```
