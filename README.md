# ❔ What Astralic Collects
Astralic will collect these for statistics and user support which only Astralic owner has acces to
- profile link
- game link
- profile pfp
- executor name
- country initial
- display name
- username
- user id
- client id
> 🔎 Astralic doesn't and will never collect IPs. I don't like my IP to be collected by random scrips, therefore i don't do that
